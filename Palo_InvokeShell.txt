## This program invoke shell which doesn't required login for every session. One session are generally enough to send multiple command with time paus required
## invoke shell give terminal to run multiple commands but issue is we get echo of our own commands, but good to run multiple commands
## Other way to run is to use client.exec_command which can run only one command and session is closed but this helps avoiding echo
## Check the other programs
